Agile Development Project

This project is the continued development of the Bad-Donuts website. This work was created by students at BCIT. This site is meant
to be an online service shop themed around donuts. It is highly customizable and comes with admin controls for site owners. Even though
an online donut shop is not the best of ideas, it provides a good template for a new online market place.



Getting Started

To run this website, clone the repository and download the node modules using "npm i". Once all dependencies are fullfilled, run the
server by opening and starting the file "server.js". This should run a copy of the site on your local machine at port 8080. Access
the site by typing "localhost:8080" into your browser.



Prerequisites

- JS
- HTML
- node.js
- mongoDB (optional* you can continue to use the Atlas database provided)



Running the Tests

To run tests for this server, simply type in "npm test" and the auto configured mocha tests will run.
